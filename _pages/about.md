Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a **second-year PhD student** in the Computer Science department at North Carolina A&T State University, working under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sajad-khorsandroo-77b19679/">Dr. Sajad Khorsandroo</a> and co-advisor <a href="http://www.mabdelsalam.com/">Dr. Mahmoud Abdelsalam</a>. I am part of the Autonomous Cybersecurity and Resilience Lab, where I focus on cutting-edge research in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Autonomous Network Management**. My research aims to enhance LLMs by integrating real-time external data through RAG while also developing AI-driven autonomous systems to optimize network operations.

Outside of research, I love spending time cooking up something new or baking treats that bring people together. Dancing is my way to unwind and just let go. When I am not doing that, you will probably find me outside taking in the beauty of nature, especially at sunset.
