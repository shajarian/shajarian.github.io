I am a **second-year PhD student** in the Computer Science department at North Carolina A&T State University, working under the guidance of Dr. Sajad Khorsandroo and co-advisor Dr. Mahmoud Abdelsalam. I am part of the Autonomous Cybersecurity and Resilience Lab, where I focus on cutting-edge research in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Autonomous Network Management**. My research aims to enhance LLMs by integrating real-time external data through RAG while also developing AI-driven autonomous systems to optimize network operations.

With a growing emphasis on Human-Centered AI, my work strives to create intelligent systems that automate complex tasks, minimize human intervention, and ensure efficiency, scalability, and user-centered outcomes in network management and beyond. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI to make technology more responsive to human needs.

Outside of research, I love spending time cooking up something new or baking treats that bring people together. Dancing is my way to unwind and just let go. When I am not doing that, you will probably find me outside taking in the beauty of nature, especially at sunset. There is something about those quiet moments that really grounds me and inspires everything else I do.
