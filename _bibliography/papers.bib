  title={Poster: Intelligent Network Management: RAG-Enhanced LLMs for Log Analysis, Troubleshooting, and Documentation},
  author={Shajarian, Shaghayegh and Khorsandroo, Sajad and Abdelsalam, Mahmoud},
  abstract={Modern network management is increasingly complex, requiring administrators to handle vast amounts of log data from diverse sources, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and operational challenges. In this work, we propose a novel AI-driven framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and human-in-the-loop process to automate network management tasks such as log analysis, troubleshooting recommendations, and documentation generation. This study aims to enhance network reliability, reduce operational complexity, and move forward to autonomous network management.},

  title={Self-Running Networks: A Comprehensive Survey of Foundations, Applications, and Challenges},
  author={Shajarian, Shaghayegh and Khorsandroo, Sajad and Abdelsalam, Mahmoud},
  abstract={Self-running networks represent a groundbreaking paradigm for achieving fully autonomous network infrastructures capable of self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing, and self-protection without human intervention. Although numerous isolated studies have explored aspects of self-running networks, an integrated and holistic overview is still lacking. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive system-level exposition, formalizing the concept of self-running networks, and detailing the architectural components that enable end-to-end autonomy through a unified seven-layer reference model. We also analyze the key self-* functionalities, including their core mechanisms, operational challenges, and representative application domains. Furthermore, we propose a six-level network autonomy maturity model to evaluate the evolution of network intelligence from manual operations to fully autonomous systems. We further synthesize foundational paradigms and practical implementations, providing a consolidated view of current advancements. In addition, we discuss critical challenges in self-running networks, including security, scalability, interoperability, and ethical considerations. Finally, we highlight research directions and open issues to guide future innovations and accelerate the deployment of self-running networks in real-world environments. This work serves as a conceptual and practical reference for researchers, practitioners, and industry stakeholders aiming to design, deploy, and advance next-generation self-running networks.},

      author={{Manthena, Harikha and Shajarian, Shaghayegh and Kimmell, Jeffrey and Abdelsalam, Mahmoud and Khorsandroo, Sajad and Gupta, Maanak},
      abstract={Machine learning (ML) has rapidly advanced in recent years, revolutionizing fields such
as finance, medicine, and cybersecurity. In malware detection, ML-based approaches have demonstrated
high accuracy; however, their lack of transparency poses a significant challenge. Traditional ML
models often fail to provide interpretable justifications for their predictions, limiting their adoption in
security-critical environments where understanding the reasoning behind a detection is essential for threat
mitigation and response. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this gap by enhancing model interpretability
while maintaining strong detection capabilities. This survey presents a comprehensive review of stateof-the-art ML techniques for malware analysis, with a specific focus on explainability methods and
research mainly from 2018 to 2024. We examine existing XAI frameworks, their application in malware
classification and detection, and the challenges associated with making malware detection models more
interpretable. Additionally, we explore recent advancements and highlight open research challenges in the
field of explainable malware analysis. By providing a structured overview of XAI-driven malware detection
approaches, this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to bridge the
gap between ML performance and explainability in cybersecurity.},

  title={Transfer learning with ResNet50 for malicious domains classification using image visualization},
  author={Demmese, Fikirte Ayalke and Shajarian, Shaghayegh and Khorsandroo, Sajad},
  abstract={The Internet has become a vital part of our daily lives, serving as a hub for global connectivity and a facilitator for seamless communication and information exchange. However, the rise of malicious domains presents a serious challenge, undermining the reliability of the Internet and posing risks to user safety. These malicious activities exploit the Domain Name System (DNS) to deceive users, leading to harmful activities such as spreading drive-by-download malware, operating botnets, creating phishing sites, and sending spam. In response to this growing threat, the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques has proven to be highly effective. These methods excel in quickly and accurately detecting, classifying, and analyzing such threats. This paper explores the latest developments in using transfer learning for the classification of malicious domains, with a focus on image visualization as a key methodological approach. Our proposed solution has achieved a remarkable testing accuracy rate of 98.67%, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and classifying malicious domains.},
